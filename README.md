## My process

### Built with

- Svelte kit
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Typescript

### What I learned

While building this project I encountered many problems which gave me the opportunity to learn more about css, svelte and web development in general. I finally got a basic understanding of svelte and svelte kit, and also revised some core css concepts.

### Continued development

I really want to focus on building and developing my CSS skills because I can't always hide behind a UI framework to do the job for me. Since svelte doesn't really have a standard UI framework, I really want to learn CSS in order for me to build my own UI components.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://www.chat.openai.com) - This helped me remember some JS concepts that I forgot.
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) - I used reddit more instead of stack overflow for the first time in order to find solutions that were really specific to svelte.
